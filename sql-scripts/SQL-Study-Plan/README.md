# 99 SQL Questions from Leetcode

This here represents all the SQL challenges I intend to undertake over the 
course of 31 days. It's a SQL bootcamp I intend to set up for myself.

Leetcode subdivides this study plan into SQL I, SQL II, and SQL III. I will
not distinguish between them in the folder structure. Instead, this repo will
separate between easy, medium, and hard questions.
